# Anarchy Game Mode

A vmangos fork for server project "Age of Chaos" which aims to create an "alternate game mode" experience called "Anarchy".

The idea behind the "Anarchy" game mode is to both bring back the WAR in World of WARcraft and also anarchy refers to there being *no rules* in this chaotic world. No longer are you bound to stay loyal to your faction. Connect with everyone on the server.

Betray your allies, join the enemy (if you wish so), separate realmwide (crossfaction) chat, general/group/whisper crossfaction chat (except channels), flagging yourself for FFA PVP and crossfaction grouping and guild (if you join the enemy your allies will know), 
and more is planned to facilitate players feeling like they are actually in a living breathing world that is AT WAR. Make no mistake, this is a PVP focused project.

Realmwide broadcasts of the latest news, events and overall happening on the realm, making you feel more connected to whats happening around you.

Custom content and Vanilla+ type of changes are also on the menu. Stay tuned.
